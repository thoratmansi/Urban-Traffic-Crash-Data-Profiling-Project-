# Urban Traffic Crash Data Profiling Project üöóüìä

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project aimed to analyze urban traffic crash data from three major cities: Austin, Chicago, and New York. The dataset comprised 3.2 million records and 131 variables. The analysis was conducted using Alteryx and Talend for data transformation and Power BI and Tableau for visualization.

## Project Objectives üéØ

- Analyze crash data from three major cities.
- Propose data transformation strategies to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Create interactive dashboards and reports for effective communication of insights.

## Tools Used üõ†Ô∏è

- Alteryx: Used for data preparation and initial analysis.
- Talend: Employed for data transformation strategies.
- Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards.
- Tableau: Used for visualization and reporting.

## Implementation Details üí°

- Accident Counts: Calculated the total number of accidents in NYC, Austin, and Chicago.
- Dashboard Presentation: Utilized visualizations like bar charts and maps to present accident counts for each city.
- Top Areas by Accidents: Identified the top 3 areas in each city with the highest number of accidents.
- Accidents Resulting in Injuries: Analyzed the number of accidents resulting only in injuries.
- Pedestrian Involvement: Examined the frequency of pedestrian involvement in accidents.
- Accident Timing: Conducted a seasonality analysis to determine when most accidents occur.
- Motorist Injuries and Fatalities: Generated reports on the number of motorists injured or killed in accidents.
- Fatal Accidents by Area: Identified the top 5 areas in each city with the highest number of fatal accidents.
- Time-Based Analysis: Analyzed accident timing, including time of day, day of the week, and weekends vs. weekdays.
- Fatality Analysis: Investigated whether pedestrians are more frequently killed than other road users.
- Common Factors in Accidents: Explored the most common contributing factors in accidents.
