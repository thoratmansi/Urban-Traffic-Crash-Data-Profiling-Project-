# Urban Traffic Crash Data Profiling Project 🚗📊

## Overview ℹ️

This project aimed to analyze urban traffic crash data from three major cities: Austin, Chicago, and New York. The dataset comprised 3.2 million records and 131 variables. The analysis was conducted using Alteryx and Talend for data transformation and Power BI and Tableau for visualization.

## Project Objectives 🎯

- Analyze crash data from three major cities.
- Propose data transformation strategies to ensure data integrity and consistency.
- Create interactive dashboards and reports for effective communication of insights.

## Tools Used 🛠️

- Alteryx: Used for data preparation and initial analysis.
- Talend: Employed for data transformation strategies.
- Power BI: Utilized for creating interactive dashboards.
- Tableau: Used for visualization and reporting.

## Implementation Details 💡

- Accident Counts: Calculated the total number of accidents in NYC, Austin, and Chicago.
- Dashboard Presentation: Utilized visualizations like bar charts and maps to present accident counts for each city.
- Top Areas by Accidents: Identified the top 3 areas in each city with the highest number of accidents.
- Accidents Resulting in Injuries: Analyzed the number of accidents resulting only in injuries.
- Pedestrian Involvement: Examined the frequency of pedestrian involvement in accidents.
- Accident Timing: Conducted a seasonality analysis to determine when most accidents occur.
- Motorist Injuries and Fatalities: Generated reports on the number of motorists injured or killed in accidents.
- Fatal Accidents by Area: Identified the top 5 areas in each city with the highest number of fatal accidents.
- Time-Based Analysis: Analyzed accident timing, including time of day, day of the week, and weekends vs. weekdays.
- Fatality Analysis: Investigated whether pedestrians are more frequently killed than other road users.
- Common Factors in Accidents: Explored the most common contributing factors in accidents.

## Conclusion 🎉

The Urban Traffic Crash Data Profiling Project successfully provided valuable insights into traffic accidents in major cities. By leveraging a combination of data transformation tools like Alteryx and Talend and visualization platforms such as Power BI and Tableau, the project achieved its objectives of analyzing crash data, proposing data transformation strategies, and creating interactive dashboards and reports. These insights can inform policymakers, city planners, and law enforcement agencies to implement targeted interventions and improve road safety.
